# datafun-06-eda

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project for the Datafun-06 project. The project aims to analyze and explore agricultural crop yield data from various countries using Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, Seaborn, and other data analytics tools.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebook set up

This project aims to demonstrate skills in conducting EDA using Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn, and other popular data analytics tools.

##  project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform analysis of agricultural crop yield data and visualize insights derived from the dataset. The analysis includes examining trends, patterns, and relationships within the data to gain meaningful insights into crop yield variations across different countries and years.

### Deliverables

- **GitHub Repository**: [datafun-06-eda](https://github.com/Tesfamariam100/datafun-06-eda.git)
- **Documentation**: README.md
- **Notebook**: Tesfamariam_eda.ipynb (not started yet)

### External Dependencies

This project uses the following external modules:

- jupyterlab
- pandas
- pyarrow
- matplotlib
- seaborn

A virtual environment is recommended to manage these dependencies.

The dataset used for this project contains information about agricultural crop yield from different countries over several years. It includes the following columns:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Environment Setup

1. Create and activate the project virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    For Windows:

    ```bash
    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate
    ```
2. Install all required packages into your local project virtual environment:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab pandas pyarrow matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3. Update or generate a requirements.txt file:

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

4. Add a .gitignore file to your project with useful entries. You can use the following content:

    ```plaintext
    # Python virtual environment
    .venv/

    # Visual Studio Code settings and workspace
    .vscode/

    # Compiled Python files
    __pycache__/

    # macOS system files
    .DS_Store

    # Editor backup files
    *~

    # Python Jupyter Notebook checkpoints and runtime files
    .ipynb_checkpoints/
    *.ipynb_meta/
    ```

5. Project start

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) process involves the following steps. 

### Data Acquisition: 
Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and inspect its structure.

### Initial Data Inspection: 
Examine the initial rows, shape, and data types of the DataFrame to understand its composition.

### Initial Descriptive Statistics: 
Compute descriptive statistics to summarize the numerical attributes of the dataset.

### Initial Data Distribution for Numerical Columns:
 Visualize the distribution of numerical columns using histograms to identify patterns and outliers.

### Initial Data Distribution for Categorical Columns: 
Explore the distribution of categorical variables to understand the frequency of different categories.

### Initial Data Transformation and Feature Engineering: 
Rename columns and add new features to enhance the dataset's readability and analytical value.

### Initial Visualizations: 
Create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and line plots to illustrate crop yield distributions, country-wise comparisons, and seasonal trends.

### Exploring Crop Production Data:
 An EDA Journey: Provide an overview of the EDA process and its goals, including loading and preprocessing data, performing exploratory analysis, visualizing crop yield, analyzing seasonal trends, and drawing conclusions for agricultural decision-making.
